# NEAR Stack - a node.js Full Stack
## About
This will be a template framework that will allow us to easily create new Node.js servers in the future, simply by cloning the repository. It is tuned to our liking and understanding, so that we can know where everything is and how everything works.
## Goals
- Full Stack - boilerplate content for all aspects of web app development, from the frontend to the backend to the databases.
- Flexible Deployment & Scalability - completely designed from the ground up to be deployed with minimal effort to as many servers as necessary.
- Automation - usage of task runners and scripts as much as possible to allow us to focus on development almost exclusively, and not have to worry about too much other stuff.
- Adaptability - easily be able to adapt the stack for any application involving node.js, from a simple html static server to a complex websocket server/client combo.

## Packages
### Confirmed
- **Server Platform: Node.js**. I think we've pretty much decided on this one from the start.
- **Application Framework: Express**. No other options are mature enough to be useful yet.
